    <h2>The BEST Pan-Seared Steak</h2>

    <p>
        This 20-minute recipe is done on the stovetop in one pan (no need to finish it in the oven). This is one of our
        favorite steak recipes and we make it year-round because it’s such a quick and convenient cooking method. That
        garlic butter is lip-smacking good! Read on for great tips on how to improve beef sustainability, reduce food
        waste and you will love our ideas for easy meal prep with leftover steak.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 bone-in ribeye steaks, at least 1 1/2 inches thick, about 1 pound (450g) each</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) oil</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30g) butter</li>
        <li>A few thyme sprigs and sliced shallots (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Pat steaks dry with paper towels. Season liberally with salt. Allow to rest at room temperature for at least
            40 minutes and up to 2 hours. Alternatively, place on a plate or on a rack over a baking sheet in the
            refrigerator overnight. Remove from refrigerator at least 40 minutes before cooking.</li>
        <li>In a large stainless-steel or cast iron skillet, heat oil over high heat until heavily smoking. Season
            steaks with pepper, add to pan, and cook, flipping frequently with tongs until well browned on all sides
            (including edges, which you can sear by holding steaks sideways with tongs) and the internal temperature has
            reached 110°F (43°C) for rare or 130°F (54°C) for medium (steak will continue to cook for a bit afterward),
            6 to 12 minutes depending on thickness.</li>
        <li>Add butter and optional aromatics to pan and continue to cook, flipping often, for an additional 2 minutes.
            Remove from pan and let rest in a warm place for at least 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
